# Deep Feedforward Neural Network and Text Analytics
### Practical Machine Learning - Assignment 2

2 part project split into:
### 1. Using a Deep Neural Network to classify images of text
Tasks undertaken:
- Reshaping + Rescaling Data
- Train / Test Split using StratifiedShuffleSplit
- Constructing a Deep Feedforward Neural Network using Tensorflow

### 2. Using Word2Vec to classify documents
Tasks undertaken:
- Embed Vectors using Word2Vec
- Identify 10 Most similar words to "Law"
- Evaluate the embeddings of both the Sum of and Average of Vectors

# Takeaways / Findings:
- The Deep Neural Network was able to reach a accuracies of 95% in Training and 90% in Tests by the 50th Epoch
