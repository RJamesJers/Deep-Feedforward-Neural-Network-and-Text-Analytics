# Deep Feedforward Neural Network and Text Analytics
### Practical Machine Learning - Assignment 2

2 Part project split into:
### 1. Using a Deep Neural Network to classify images of text
Tasks undertaken:
- Reshaping + Rescaling Data
- Train / Test SPlit using StratifiedShuffleSplit
- Constructing a Deep Feedforward Neural Network using Tensorflow

### 2. Using Word2Vec to classify documents
Tasks undertaken:
- Embed Vectors using Word2Vec
- Identify 10 Most similar words to "Law"
- Evaluate the Embeddings of both the Sum of and Average of Vectors
